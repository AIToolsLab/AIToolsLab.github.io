    "text": "Vision\n        \n          \n            \n              Under the guidance of Dr. Ken Arnold, the Thoughtful AI lab conducts research into applications of large language models (LLMs)\n              which enhance—but do not replace—the users’ writing. Our lab focuses on two categories of these applications: AI-generated\n              feedback for the revision stage of writing and AI-generated recommendations for the drafting stage of writing.\n            \n            \n              From 2023-2024, we developed a Microsoft Word add-in whose AI-generated suggestions were primed for modification and personalization,\n              facilitating more fine-grained involvement in the writing process. This year, we aim to further this work in four ways:\n              publishing an analysis of prior user studies on our system, utilizing the report’s findings to improve user experience, designing a\n              longitudinal study with the improved system, and integrating revision/drafting features into a single app published on the Microsoft\n              Store.\n            \n            For more context on our project, you can read our original project proposal\n              here.\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Research question we aim to address in this project:\n          \n          \n            \n              How might writers’ interactions with each of the suggestion types emulate each stage of the writing process?\n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n        Approaches\n        \n          \n            \n              We developed a Microsoft Word add-in that offered next-sentence suggestions expressed in four different\n              ways:\n            \n            \n              Completion of a current thought: provides a single pre-written\n                sentence\n              A question about current/future writing: a question the writer could\n                answer in the next sentence\n              A list of possible vocabulary: vocabulary to use in the next sentence\n              A rhetorical strategy to employ: directions on the kind of sentence\n                to write, such as citing statistics, offering a personal anecdote, incorporating a counterargument, etc.\n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n        Demo\n        \n          \n          Try it yourself!\n        \n      \n\n      \n        Outcomes\n        \n          Placeholder\n          The full report of our findings can be found\n            here.\n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n        Future Work\n        \n        On the research end, we plan to: \n          \n            Iterate on our current study design in a follow-up deployment study\n            Debrief with the development team on opportunities for additional functionality or affordances\n          \n        \n        \n          On the development end, we plan to: \n          \n            Improve system robustness\n            Improve UI/UX in collaboration with the research team\n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n        Our Team\n        \n          \n            \n              \n              Jason Chew\n            \n            Whether it be in code or in composition, Jason enjoys applying his syntactical skills across\n              a variety of domains—a trait which has made him particularly interested in the intersection of AI and writing.\n          \n          \n            \n              \n              Daniel Kim\n            \n            Daniel is passionate about human-computer interaction and designing intuitive user interfaces.\n              Amidst the widespread proliferation of AI technologies, Daniel aims to develop AI-powered tools\n              that are both useful and user-friendly.\n          \n          \n            \n              \n              Dr. Kenneth C.

    "text": "Poster presented at 2024 Calvin University Summer Research Poster Fair.\nIn Summer 2024, our team of undergraduate students conducted a study on how the type of information suggested by an AI writing assistant affects writers’ cognitive engagement with the suggestion and how they appropriate that suggestion in their draft. We developed a Microsoft Word sidebar that offered next-sentence suggestions expressed in four different ways: in addition to predictive-text-style examples they could use verbatim (e.g., by copy-and-paste), we also allowed writers to request questions that the next sentence might answer, vocabulary they might use, and rhetorical moves (such as giving examples or considering counterarguments) that their next sentence might engage with.\nIn a pilot study (N=8), writers found questions and rhetorical moves to be useful and friendly. Although writers chose to request examples more often, they often rejected the suggested text. Overall, they rated the Questions suggestion type as most compelling in post-task surveys, followed by Examples. These preliminary results suggest that writers welcomed AI suggestions that could not be inserted verbatim into their documents but instead required further thought. Overall, by offering intentionally-incomplete suggestions like Questions or Rhetorical Moves, AI systems might become better cognitive partners for writers, enriching thinking rather than circumventing it. This work has been presented at an internal poster fair; we are designing a follow-up experiment to build on these findings for broader publication."
