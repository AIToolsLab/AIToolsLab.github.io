# Our Vision

One of the ways that humans care for each other and contribute to each other's well-being is through thinking about each other. So instead of generating content for people, AI should help people think *better* and *more deeply* about the people they're serving---whether readers, students, teammates, or communities.

# The Challenge

Naive uses of generative AI, focused narrowly on reductionist notions of efficiency and productivity, threaten human thought by promoting cognitive disengagement and shortcut thinking.

*Writing* is one of the main uses of generative AI today. But most uses cede substantial parts of the writing process to LLMs. But writing is *thinking*, not just content production.

Although people *could* carefully read and verify LLM output, the cognitive shortcut is extremely tempting. And even when we do read the output carefully, we don't even know what we *could have thought about* had we engaged more deeply with the writing process.

# Our Work

Our work asks questions like:

- What is the *minimal essence that the computer could helpfully contribute* to our thinking that's *useful *(gets us to think of something we wouldn't have thought of on our own) and not *invasive* (stepping on our own thoughts/agency, cognitive interference, ...)?
- What *processes* (of reflective revision, etc.) could we encourage through making them "default" in writing tools?
- What *collaboration patterns* become possible when humans craft computationally mediated reflective practices together?

But AI *could* help us think better about others: expressing thoughts in ways that are easy to correctly understand, anticipating the otherwise "unanticipated" outcomes of our words and actions, and encapsulating practices of reflection and mindful action.
